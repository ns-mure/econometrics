Description: This package, developed for the Upwork Contract ID 16581251,
    provides functions for importing data from SQL database and econometric
    analyses on that data. The regressions cover random effects, fixed effects,
    and instrument variable models. The script is written in R and the code is
    structured with explanatory comments on average every 2 code lines (in English).
    The script is flexible so the user can chose file paths, set the parameters for
    the regression like Y and Xs, choose the type of model (single or multiple),
    choose tests (single or multiple). After the setup, the code runs automatically
    without user interaction, displays and saves the results.
